Once upon a time there was a giraffe called Gary, who was a keen coder.
Gary struggles to code because his neck is too long to see his monitor screen. It's a health and safety nightmare!
Gary was a giraffe of many mysteries, namely he had an extra shoulder.
One unfortunate day, he was trampled over by a pony called Rainbow Dash.
At Gary's funeral, his wife and kids sobbed for hours.
