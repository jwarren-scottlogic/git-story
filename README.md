Once upon a time there was a giraffe called Gary, who was a keen coder.
Gary struggled to code because his neck was too long to see his monitor screen. He did not meet DSE requirements!
Gary was a giraffe of many mysteries, namely he had an extra shoulder, on which sat a wise parrot who was also a genie.
One unfortunate day, he was trampled over by a pony called Rainbow Dash.
At Gary's funeral, his wife and kids sobbed for hours.
Who are you and why are you reviewing my code?
